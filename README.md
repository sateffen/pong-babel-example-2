# Pong babel example 2 #

This is a second generation of my [pong babel example](https://github.com/sateffen/pong-babel-example),
where I want to test multiple build-setups for bundling javascript projects.

Following conditions:

* The code has to be transpiled with babel
* The bundle has to be minified
* The bundler has to integrate with karma

In this setup I'm testing the folling bundlers:

* webpack
* browserify
* rollup
* partially closure-compiler
